                Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, the third-busiest airport in Europe, and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily.[13] It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems[15] and is one of only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.[16]</p>
